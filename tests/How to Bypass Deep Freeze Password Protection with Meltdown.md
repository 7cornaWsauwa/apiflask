# How to Bypass Deep Freeze Password Protection with Meltdown
 
Deep Freeze is a software that protects your Windows system from unauthorized changes by freezing it to a desired state. Any changes made to the system are discarded after rebooting, restoring it to its original configuration. However, this also means that you cannot make any permanent changes to your system without knowing the password set by the administrator.

If you have forgotten the password or want to access a system that is protected by Deep Freeze, you can use a tool called Meltdown to bypass the password protection and generate a one-time password (OTP) that will allow you to unfreeze the system. Meltdown is a program that exploits a vulnerability in the communication protocol between the Deep Freeze user interface and the driver. It can obtain the information necessary for OTP generation from the driver and display it on the screen.
 
In this article, we will show you how to download and use Meltdown to bypass Deep Freeze password protection on Windows systems.
 
## Step 1: Download Meltdown
 
You can download Meltdown from this link: [https://www.mediafire.com/?mtpaf3quaifwm3u](https://www.mediafire.com/?mtpaf3quaifwm3u). This is a zip file that contains two files: meltdown.exe and readme.txt. You can extract them to any folder on your system.
 
## Step 2: Run Meltdown
 
Before running Meltdown, make sure that Deep Freeze is running on your system. You can check this by looking for the Deep Freeze icon on the system tray. It should be blue if it is frozen and red if it is thawed.
 
Double-click on meltdown.exe to launch it. You will see a window like this:

Meltdown will automatically detect the version of Deep Freeze installed on your system and display the OTP for unfreezing it. You can also choose to generate an OTP for freezing or thawing the system by clicking on the corresponding buttons.
 
## Step 3: Use the OTP
 
Now that you have the OTP, you can use it to unfreeze your system and make any changes you want. To do this, follow these steps:
 
1. Press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+F6 to open the Deep Freeze password dialog box.
2. Type in the OTP generated by Meltdown and click OK.
3. You will see a message saying "Password OK. System will be Thawed on next reboot."
4. Reboot your system and wait for it to start up.
5. Your system will be unfrozen and you can make any changes you want.

To freeze your system again, you can either use another OTP generated by Meltdown or set a new password in the Deep Freeze configuration console.
 
## Conclusion
 
Meltdown is a handy tool that can help you bypass Deep Freeze password protection and access your system without any restrictions. However, it also exposes a security flaw in Deep Freeze that can be exploited by malicious users. Therefore, you should use Meltdown only for legitimate purposes and not abuse it. You should also keep your system updated with the latest version of Deep Freeze that may fix this vulnerability in the future.

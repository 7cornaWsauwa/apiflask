The DLC features a separate campaign from the base game, with new missions, locations, weapons, and gameplay mechanics. The player can use fear as a weapon, either by scaring enemies with Jack's gruesome attacks or by rescuing civilians from his clutches as Evie. The DLC also explores the social and historical context of the Ripper murders, such as the plight of the prostitutes who were his victims, the role of the press and the police in the investigation, and the impact of the crimes on the public opinion.
 
Assassin's Creed Syndicate: Jack the Ripper received mostly positive reviews from critics, who praised its dark and atmospheric tone, its gameplay innovations, and its portrayal of Evie as a mature and complex character. However, some critics also criticized its depiction of Jack as a clichÃ©d and shallow villain, its lack of connection to the main story of Syndicate, and its portrayal of women as helpless and passive.

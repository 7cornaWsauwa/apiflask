Some players may find the game too challenging or want to have more fun with the game's mechanics. For them, there is a trainer available that can modify the game's settings and give players various cheats and advantages. The trainer is called Hitman Absolution Trainer 1.0 433.1 Skidrow 159 and it was created by a group of hackers known as Skidrow.
 
The trainer can be downloaded from various websites that host game mods and hacks. However, players should be careful when downloading files from unknown sources, as they may contain viruses or malware that can harm their computers. Players should also be aware that using the trainer may affect the game's performance and stability, and may also disable some of the game's features, such as achievements and online modes.
 
To use the trainer, players need to follow these steps:
 
1. Extract the trainer file from the downloaded archive and place it in the same folder as the game's executable file.
2. Run the trainer as administrator and wait for it to detect the game.
3. Press F1 to activate the trainer and hear a confirmation sound.
4. Select the desired cheats from the trainer's menu by pressing the corresponding keys.
5. Enjoy the game with the cheats enabled.

The trainer offers a variety of cheats, such as:

- Unlimited health: Agent 47 will not die from any damage.
- Unlimited ammo: Agent 47 will never run out of bullets or other weapons.
- No reload: Agent 47 will not need to reload his weapons.
- Unlimited instinct: Agent 47 will always have full instinct meter.
- Invisible mode: Agent 47 will not be seen by enemies or cameras.
- Silent mode: Agent 47 will not make any noise when moving or killing.
- Super speed: Agent 47 will move faster than normal.
- Super jump: Agent 47 will jump higher than normal.
- One hit kill: Agent 47 will kill any enemy with one shot or attack.
- Add money: Agent 47 will gain more money for completing missions.

The trainer can be deactivated by pressing F1 again or by closing the trainer window. Players should also save their game before using the trainer, as they may encounter bugs or glitches that can corrupt their save files.
  
However, using the trainer is not the only way to enjoy Hitman Absolution. The game also offers a lot of tips and tricks that can help players master the game and complete the missions in different ways. Here are some of them:

- Use elements of the environment to your advantage. You can distract enemies with noise, lure them with items, or kill them with accidents. For example, you can shoot a fire extinguisher to create an explosion, or drop a chandelier on someone's head.
- Use disguises to blend in with the crowd and avoid suspicion. You can find various outfits throughout the game, such as police uniforms, chef costumes, or priest robes. However, be careful not to get too close to people who can see through your disguise, such as guards or colleagues.
- Use your instinct mode to see enemies and objects of interest through walls. You can also use it to activate point shooting, which allows you to mark multiple targets and kill them in slow motion. However, your instinct meter will deplete as you use it, so use it wisely.
- Use your signature weapons, the Silverballers, to kill enemies silently and efficiently. You can also upgrade them with various attachments, such as silencers, scopes, or extended magazines. You can also use other weapons that you find or take from enemies, such as knives, hammers, or guns.
- Use lethal or non-lethal methods to eliminate your targets. You can choose to kill them with weapons, accidents, or poison, or you can choose to subdue them with chokeholds, fiber wires, or syringes. You can also hide their bodies in containers, closets, or dumpsters to avoid detection.

Hitman Absolution is a game that rewards creativity and experimentation. You can complete the missions in various ways and earn different ratings and challenges. You can also replay the missions and try different approaches and strategies. The game also has a Contracts mode, where you can create your own custom missions and share them online with other players.
